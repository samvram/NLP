# Naive Bayes Classifier

In this assignment, we will build various text classification models and use them to classify sentences from 2016 presidential debates(United States of America) according to speakers.

## Classifier Characteristics
Implementing a Na√Øve Bayes classifier:-

We need **P(class|sentence)** = **P(class|w1)** **P(class|w2)** **P(class|w3)**... 

* Wrote code to read in the training documents and collect counts,  for all speakers, and all words.
* Wrote code to compute the probabilities, **P(word|class)** which will act as a prior probability for finding **P(class|word)**.
* Trained the data on the training set present in the file `train`.
* Wrote code to compute the probabilities **P(class|sentence)** for each sentence, tested on `dev`
* Ran the code for all sentences in `test` and reported the output, accuracy. 

## Formulae and Assumptions

* **P(word)** = count(word)/Sum(count(All words in BagOfWords))
* **P(class)** = count(class)/Sum(count(All classes present))
* **P(word|class)** = count(word in class)/sum(count(all words in class))
* **P(class|word)** = **P(word|class)** x **P(class)** / **P(word)**
* **Sentence** = **w1** **w2** **w3** ....
* **P(class|sentence)** = **P(class|w1)** **P(class|w2)** **P(class|w3)**... 
* **Prediction** is done by selecting the class which has **M**aximum **A**posteriori **P**robability(**MAP**)
## Evaluation

There are 2 codes present
* `code.py` - This is the inital code with no extra implementation and it 
gives the results as follows:-

```
455 Clintons instances of speech
637 Trumps instances of speech
84 Clinton says Country
182 Clinton says President

The first sentence in dev was mostly spoken by paul with a  probability of 0.986688830667
1.0 is sum of all probabilities

* `improve_code.py` - This is a slightly modified code whose bag of word has been
reduced to essential words only. This gives results as follows:-

## Conclusion
The results clearly show that the accuracy of both the classifiers are well above
the required thresold of **50%**, which is the probability of random guess.
